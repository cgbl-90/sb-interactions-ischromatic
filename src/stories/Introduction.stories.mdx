<Meta title="Interaction testing with isChromatic()" />

# Problem

When you run interaction testing at Storybook, Chromatic only snapshots one state of the test

For example, let's say that the test has 5 steps.

Chromatic will snapshot the latest state of the component

# Solution

Use isChromatic() function to stop the test at certain step
